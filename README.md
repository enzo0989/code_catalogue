# code_catalogue

Hey! This repository is exclusively created to catalog snippets of code that i consider that could be useful in future projects.

The main source from which i take this snippets are my solutions for different problems in the CS50X and CS50P courses from Harvard, but in the future i'll add more from projects made by myself.

Every snippet will have some comments to explain the context in which it was created and some explanation on how it works.

Thank you for reading this and i hope that you find something useful <3
